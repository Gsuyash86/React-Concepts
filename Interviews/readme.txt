When does Plain html and javascript is faster then react ?

Plain HTML and JavaScript can be faster than React in certain scenarios. React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, but it comes with some overhead in terms of virtual DOM diffing and component rendering.
Here are some situations where plain HTML and JavaScript might be faster:

Simple Static Websites: For simple static websites with just a few pages and minimal interactivity, using plain HTML and JavaScript can be faster. 
There's no need for the additional complexity and library size that React brings.

Small-Scale Projects: If you're working on a small project with a limited number of dynamic components, React might be overkill.
Plain HTML and JavaScript can provide a lightweight solution that's faster to set up and has lower runtime overhead.

Performance-Critical Applications: In applications where every millisecond of performance is critical, you might choose to hand-optimize your HTML and JavaScript code for maximum speed.
React, while fast, introduces some abstraction that can add a small performance overhead.

SEO Optimization: For SEO optimization, server-side rendering (SSR) or pre-rendering techniques can be used. 
These techniques often work better with plain HTML because search engine bots can easily parse the content.

Legacy Systems: In some cases, you might be working with legacy systems that don't easily integrate with modern front-end libraries or frameworks.
In such scenarios, plain HTML and JavaScript may be the most practical choice.

Resource Constraints: If you are working on a project with strict resource constraints, such as very limited memory or CPU power, using plain HTML and JavaScript can be a more efficient use of those resources.

It's important to note that React is designed to optimize developer productivity and maintainability of code, which often outweighs the minor performance trade-offs in many applications.
Furthermore, the performance gap between plain HTML/JavaScript and React has been narrowing with each React update, and many optimizations have been made to make React faster.

In most cases, the choice between plain HTML/JavaScript and React should be based on the specific requirements of your project, your development team's expertise, and your long-term maintenance goals.
You can also use a hybrid approach, integrating React for parts of your application where it provides the most benefit and using plain HTML/JavaScript for simpler or performance-critical sections.

When Does we use Custom Hooks, and how is it different from using the utility function in React ? 

Custom Hooks in React are a way to reuse stateful logic and side effects in functional components. They are similar to utility functions in that they help you encapsulate and reuse code, but they are specific to React components. 
Here are some scenarios in which you might use Custom Hooks and how they differ from using utility functions:

When to Use Custom Hooks:

Reusing Component Logic: Custom Hooks are useful when you have logic that needs to be shared across multiple components.
For example, if you have several components that need to access the user's location, you can create a useLocation hook to encapsulate that logic.

Managing State Logic: If you have complex state management and side effect logic that would make your component too long or difficult to maintain, you can move that logic into a Custom Hook. 
This can make your components cleaner and more focused on the UI.

Abstracting Complex Behavior: Custom Hooks can abstract away complex behavior or integration with external libraries. For example, you might create a hook to handle web socket connections, form handling, or data fetching.

Promoting Reusability: Custom Hooks promote code reusability and maintainability by making it easy to share and reuse logic across different parts of your application.

Differences from Utility Functions:

React-Specific: Custom Hooks are specific to React. They can access and manage React's state, lifecycle, and context, which utility functions cannot do.
Utility functions are general-purpose functions that can be used in any JavaScript context.

Access to React Features: Custom Hooks have access to React features like useState, useEffect, and context. This allows you to encapsulate and share component-specific logic that interacts with these React features.

Component Lifecycle Integration: Custom Hooks can synchronize with the component's lifecycle, making them more suitable for managing things like subscriptions, effects, or other behavior tied to the lifecycle of a component.

Cleaner Component Code: Custom Hooks help keep your component code cleaner and more focused on rendering, while the logic is abstracted into separate hooks. Utility functions are typically called within a component, which may lead to a mix of UI and logic in the same function.
